a.	What is unit testing, how is it implemented, and why is it important?

Unit testing uses isolation to test the module so that only its behavior is verified.  This method is important because it gives the tester a better idea how the module will respond to external conditions by testing it under controlled conditions.  The code should be located in an area easily accessed by developers, either located in the module itself or in a subdirectory of the unit being tested.
 
b.	What is functional testing, how is it implemented, and why is it important?

Functional testing is performed by testing the functional requirements of the software being tested.  The hope of functional testing is that the program physically performs the tasks that it was intended to do and conforms to industry standards.

c.	What is the significance and usage of automated unit testing in software development?

Automated unit testing executes tests without manual intervention which provides a low cost re-testing solution that controls risk when code is changed.   This usually results in better stability, portability and efficient interface designs.

d.	Where would you commonly find automated unit testing implemented?  Can you find any documentation online that describes this and post a link to it?
Automated unit testing is useful in test driven environments where the new code needs to pass predefined tests and are run repeatedly until it passes.  http://www.renaissancesoftware.net/files/articles/ESC-241Paper_Grenning-v1r1.pdf

e.	 What is test driven development and how can it improve the management and quality of software projects.
This style of development involves the test being written prior to the code that will run the software.  The new code is only accepted after it passes the tests written specifically for it.  Test driven development often reduces regression significantly, improves interface design and makes implementation easier.
